You'll be installing the extension in Google Chrome using developer mode.

##Modify scripts to personalize

*You'll just need to open it this one time, so you shouldn't need to change default program permanently.*


**STEP 4:**

![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Modify the lines above for the *msg* javascript object. 
**NOTE: Changing anything except what is inside quotes will break the code**


For the message, you should change the default. I recommend using:

1. a unique last sentence (it's part of snip 3)
2. a personal closing (Kind regards, Have a good day, etc.)
3. your own name (modify 'agent' attribute)
